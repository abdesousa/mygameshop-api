## General info
I created this api to demonstrate my abilities as software developer.

## Recommended design

* Diagram (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gJwMP_OZ5IY0R1_o0F8XPnGH2ItXz4Ga)

* Host: Cloud (Azure) - Cloud can bring benefits like multi region, auto scale,multi tenant, monitoring and backup tools.
* Container oriented: Fits better in a scenario where high scalability is mandatory, once, it is possible automatically add more resources (memory or vcpus) or even add more containers running in parallel.
* Security: Application gateway with DDoS protection plus security groups well defined increases the reliability of the solution.

## Technologies

* Spring Boot (Actuator, Security, JPA)
* H2 (In memory)
* JUnit
* Flyway
* Jackson Mapper
* Basic Authentication
* Docker
* Swagger2

## Decisions Made:
* URL Shortener: Since I never created a URL shortener, I focused on my strengths. During the week I will update the project with a solution for this.
* Security: Basic Authentication on the data in transit in order to ensure a reliable communication to the single test application. Think about the use of oAuth2 instead of basic authentication for 
solution which requires a high level of security.  
* Spring boot: Once I have a large background with java Springboot was the natural choose. With Spring is possible to create robust apis in few lines of code.
* H2: The best solution to integrate natively with spring-data.
* Flyway: To create the database as a code using the migrations 
* JUNIT: All of the unit tests were created using junit and Mockito.
* One single project: Once this is a small test to evaluate my skills I have invlude everything in one single project. It is recommended to split on small project in order to be possible increase the individual scalability. 
* Swagger2: One of the most used framework to document apis.
* Lack Integration tests: Once it is possible to test the api through Swagger Integration tests weren't created.
* Exception handling: Use standard (SQLException, JDBCException...) exceptions instead of custom. 
* Logging: Rolling appender should be considered to rotate the log file to avoid large files on the storage.


## API
```
* product/: List all available products 

* product/{id}: Get information about a product based on the product ID.
```

## Setup
Once the docker image isn't deployed on the DockerHUB, you should follow the steps below:

1- Clone the project.

```
https://github.com/abdesousa/mygameshop-api.git
```
2- Build the project. 

```
mvn clean package docker:build
```

3- Run the container.

```
docker-compose up
```

4- Open the browser and type http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui.html.
